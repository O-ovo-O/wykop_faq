[^1] - Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Box

[^2] - feature not needed if proper tagging with tag cloud would work

[^3] - while many clain gdpr/dsgvo/rodo compliance, or secure data storage - not many do. Data should be importable/exportable, encrypted, impossible to be viewed/edited by anyone by owner


[^30] - interesting, lets one create nice graph, (re)order tasks

[^31] - very simple, easy to use, however - no import /export, attachments kept on remote server (only links saved), web only

[^32] - BaseCamp - initially nice, but somehow Lineup does not seem to show the tasks on view.


[^99] - while some might want to view Gantt chart/roadmap, others prefer: - "sprint board" what is planned/backlog, - task grouped by tag/topic/project/thema/status/assigne/due-date/prio/completion

Eh, GH markdown is crap, sets .container-lg max-width to 1012px. Luckily one can change that with orange script or similar, and set `max-width: 95% !important;`
